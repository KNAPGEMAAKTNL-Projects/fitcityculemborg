# FITCITY CULEMBORG - Development Brief

## Reference Documents
Before planning, read:
- This project brief (client-specific requirements)

## Project Overview

Fitcity Culemborg is an affordable, no-frills fitness center in Culemborg that positions itself as "De meest betaalbare sportschool van de regio" (The most affordable gym in the region). Founded in August 2018, Fitcity serves a diverse community including working professionals, students, and a significant Moroccan population.

The gym differentiates itself through three core offerings: quality fitness equipment (Nautilus, Technogym, Sports Art), a dedicated ladies-only section (~25% of membership base, currently expanding), and kickboxing programs for adults aged 18-35. Additionally, Fitcity is MDT-certified (Maatschappelijke Diensttijd), positioning them as a social enterprise working with municipalities and schools on youth development programs.

The current website (fitcityculemborg.nl) is an incomplete WordPress site with placeholder "Lorem ipsum" content that cannot convert visitors. The primary goal is to create a conversion-focused website that captures membership signups online while maintaining the owner's preferred manual Mollie subscription management process. Success will be measured by any new membership acquired through the website, with a broader business goal of 10% membership growth.

4. Signup: Paper form with SEPA mandaat details
5. Payment: €17 inschrijfkosten paid on location for liquidity
6. Recurring: Rashid manually creates customer/subscription in Mollie

**Owner Preference:** Wants online form collection but manual Mollie management (no automatic subscription creation)

### Target Audience

**Primary Demographics:**

- Age range: 18-45 primarily

- Concerned about shower availability (addressed by honest positioning)

**Geographic Reach:**
- Primary: 80% Culemborg city
- Secondary: Beusichem, Buren, Tricht, Buurmalsen, Rumpt, Beeds, Zoelmond (towns with limited gym options)
- Realistic service area: 10-15 minute drive from Culemborg

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Local Competitors:**
- **Healthcenter Culemborg** - Higher end, wellness/sauna, 36 group classes/week, higher pricing
- **Circle Fit Culemborg** - 30-minute circuit training, 24/7 access, €37.50/4 weeks, beginner-focused (similar to Milon concept)
- **Training Factory Culemborg** - Kickboxing, BJJ, fitness, fighting bootcamp
- **Gunther's Family Fit** - Larger operation (10-19 employees)
- **Coret Fitness V.O.F.** - Local independent

**Regional Chains:**
- Basic-Fit (low-budget national chain)

**Fitcity's Differentiation:**
1. **Price + Quality Equipment** - Lowest pricing but premium equipment brands (Nautilus, Technogym, Sports Art)
2. **Ladies-Only Section** - Rare offering in Culemborg, culturally significant
3. **Kickboxing Integration** - Combined membership options
4. **MDT Certification** - Social enterprise status, youth development programs
5. **No-Frills Honesty** - Transparent about what they offer and don't offer
6. **Friendly Vibe** - Balance of leaving people alone and being available to help

**Competitive Positioning:** Not competing with wellness centers (Healthcenter) or 24/7 convenience gyms (Circle Fit). Targeting serious fitness enthusiasts and budget-conscious members who prioritize equipment quality and variety over amenities.

## Service Area & Local Strategy

- **Service Area:** Culemborg (80%) + surrounding towns (20%)

1. **Fitness Culemborg** (primary, most volume)
2. **Fitness Beusichem**
3. **Fitness Buren** 
4. **Fitness Tricht**
5. **Fitness Buurmalsen**

Each page should:
- Target "[fitness/sportschool] [city name]" keywords

- 10-minute walk from train station

## Design Direction & Brand

### Visual Style Preference
**Moderately Expressive** - Balance of visuals and content
- Professional structure with energetic personality
- Not minimal/sterile (not like medical site)
- Not overwhelming/cluttered (not overly "extreme" fitness vibe)
- Inspiration: Circle Fit's clean consistency with brand colors
- Think: Basic-Fit evolution (clean, branded, accessible)

### Emotional Goals
Primary emotions to evoke:
1. **Energy & Motivation** - Like the gym's Arnold/Rock/Ronnie Coleman posters
2. **Welcoming & Accessible** - "You belong here regardless of fitness level"

### Brand Personality
**Core Words:** Energetic, Motivating, Ambitious, Inclusive

**How This Translates:**
- Energetic: Bold yellow (#FFE303) used confidently, dynamic layouts
- Motivating: Action-oriented copy, "Start Today" CTAs, transformation focus
- Ambitious: Serious equipment, goal-oriented messaging
- Inclusive: Ladies-only section prominence, welcoming tone, diverse imagery

### Existing Brand Assets
**Logo:** Provided (fitcity-logo.png)
- Black silhouettes (male + female with dumbbells) on bright yellow
- "FITCITY" in grunge-textured bold type
- "CULEMBORG" in clean yellow type on black bar
- Conveys: Inclusive (both genders), strong, energetic

**Favicon:** Provided (favicon.png)
- Just the silhouettes without text
- Works well at small sizes

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary:** #FFE303 (bright yellow - brand color)
- **Secondary:** #000000 (black)
- **Accent:** Consider dark grays for text, white for backgrounds
- **Emphasis:** Use yellow strategically (not overwhelming)

**Typography:**
- Logo uses grunge/distressed bold sans-serif
- Website should use clean, modern sans-serif fonts
- High readability for pricing tables and forms

**Photography:**
- Placeholder containers initially (images to be added later)
- Eventually: Gym equipment photos, ladies-only section, kickboxing dojo
- Motivational stock photos acceptable for hero sections
- Avoid overly polished/fake gym stock photos (maintain authentic vibe)

### Design References
**Websites Admired:**

- **Basic-Fit** - Clear membership card selection, pricing transparency

**What to Avoid:**
- Overly corporate/medical feeling
- Heavy text blocks without visuals
- Cluttered layouts
- Generic stock photo overuse
- Complicated navigation

## User Experience & Conversion Strategy

### Primary Conversion Goal
**#1 Action:** Membership signup (online form submission with all SEPA details)

**Secondary Actions:**
- Tryout/rondleiding request
- Contact form submission
- Phone call during business hours
- WhatsApp message

### User Journey

**Discovery Phase:**
- **How they find the site:** 
  - Organic search: "sportschool Culemborg", "fitness Culemborg"
  - Google Business Profile
  - Word of mouth → Google search
  - Social media (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook)
  
- **Mindset:** 
  - Looking for affordable gym option
  - Checking if equipment meets their needs
  - Ladies may be seeking privacy/cultural accommodation
  - Want to verify legitimacy before visiting

**Consideration Phase:**
- **Key Questions They Need Answered:**
  1. How much does it cost? (pricing transparency critical)
  2. What equipment do you have?
  3. Are there showers? (address honestly in FAQ)
  4. Can I try it first? (tryout options clear)
  5. Is there parking?
  6. What are the opening hours?
  7. Is there really a ladies-only section?
  8. What's included in kickboxing classes?
  
- **Objections to Address:**
  - No showers → Position as "no-frills keeps costs low", lockers available
  - Never heard of them → Google reviews, established since 2018, quality equipment brands
  - Too cheap = low quality? → Show equipment brands, honest about what they offer
  - Contract commitment → Show flex month-to-month options available

**Decision Phase:**
- **Primary CTA:** "Word Lid" or "Start Vandaag" (Become a Member / Start Today)
- **Friction Reducers:**

  - Clear 6-month and month-to-month options (not just annual)
  - Visual membership cards (like Circle Fit/Basic-Fit) not dropdown

**Organization:**

- Ladies Only page: Privacy/access questions

- Prijzen page: Pricing/contract questions

### Content Sourcing

**From Client:**
- Basic information about services (already provided in discovery)
- Pricing packages (already provided)
- Opening hours (already provided)
- MDT Break Out details (awaiting from owner)
- Photos (to be added later, placeholders for now)

**To Be Created (by designer/developer):**
- All copywriting for pages (casual, friendly, motivational tone)
- FAQ answers (based on common questions discussed)
- Page structure and flow
- Call-to-action text
- Form instructions and legal text (SEPA mandaat, privacy policy, terms)

**Approval Process:**
- Initial draft: Create all copy based on discovery insights
- Review: Yannick reviews for accuracy and tone
- Refinement: Adjust based on feedback
- Final: Rashid gives verbal approval (minimal involvement needed)

### Tone of Voice

**Style Guide:**
- **Pronoun:** "jij/je" (casual) not "u" (formal)
- **Energy Level:** Motivational but not aggressive, enthusiastic without being cheesy
- **Sentence Length:** Mix of short punchy sentences and medium explanatory ones
- **Personality:** Friendly gym buddy who knows their stuff, not corporate gym brand
- **Honesty:** Direct about what they offer and don't offer (no showers = keeps prices low)
- **Inclusivity:** Welcoming to all fitness levels, genders, backgrounds

**Example Sentences:**
- ❌ "Wij bieden u een uitstekende sportervaring met hoogwaardige faciliteiten." (too formal, corporate)
- ✅ "Train met topapparatuur van Nautilus en Technogym, zonder de hoge prijzen." (casual, clear value)

- ❌ "Onze sportfaciliteit is voorzien van state-of-the-art equipment." (too formal, vague)
- ✅ "Alle basics zijn gedekt: vrije gewichten, kabelapparaten, cardio. Alles wat je nodig hebt om je doelen te bereiken." (specific, motivational)

- ❌ "Het is mogelijk om gebruik te maken van onze speciale dames-afdeling." (passive, boring)
- ✅ "Train in privacy in onze aparte Ladies Only ruimte. Dezelfde kwaliteit, extra comfort." (active, benefit-focused)

**AI-Avoidance:**
- No: "embark on your fitness journey", "state-of-the-art", "comprehensive", "cutting-edge"
- Yes: "start vandaag", "topapparatuur", "alles wat je nodig hebt", "gewoon goed"

- **XSS Prevention:** Sanitize all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Parameterized queries
- **GDPR Compliance:** Privacy policy, consent checkboxes, right to deletion

### Cookie Policy

- **Phase 2:** If analytics added, implement compliant cookie consent (Cookiebot or similar)
- **Admin Panel:** Session cookie for authentication (essential cookie, no consent needed)

## Success Criteria

7. DNS cutover and launch (end Week 4)

### Budget Considerations
- Development: Fixed scope (features defined above)
- Hosting: Free (Cloudflare Pages)
- Domain: Existing (fitcityculemborg.nl)
- Services: Minimal cost (email service ~$10/month)
- Photos: Client will add later (placeholders for now)
- Copywriting: Included (drafted by developer, reviewed by client)

### Resource Availability

**Client Side (Rashid):**
- Minimal involvement needed (per his preference)
- Review and approve final copy (quick verbal approval)
- Provide MDT Break Out details when ready
- DNS access for domain pointing
- Decision making: Via Yannick as intermediary

**Yannick's Role:**
- Primary contact and decision maker
- Content review and approval
- Photo upload post-launch
- Testing and QA
- Handles communication with Rashid

**Content Delivery:**
- Copy: Drafted by developer based on discovery (Yannick reviews)
- Photos: Placeholders initially, Yannick adds later
- Pricing: Already provided
- Legal text: Standard templates customized for Fitcity

**Technical Access:**
- Domain DNS: Client will provide
- Email account: itnerdnl@gmail.com (already known)
- Social media: Links only, no API access needed
- Google Business Profile: No API integration needed

## High-Priority Focus Areas

These critical success factors should guide all technical and design decisions:

### 1. Conversion-Focused Design
**Why:** Primary goal is membership signups
**How:**
- Clear "Word Lid" CTA on every page
- Visual membership cards (like Circle Fit) not dropdowns
- Remove friction from signup process
- Trust signals prominently placed (reviews, equipment brands)
- Mobile-optimized forms (large tap targets, minimal typing)

### 2. Local SEO Dominance
**Why:** 80% of business comes from Culemborg area searches
**How:**
- Target "sportschool Culemborg" + variations
- Location pages for secondary cities
- Google Business Profile integration
- LocalBusiness Schema markup
- Location mentioned in every page title/meta
- Opening hours structured data

### 3. Ladies-Only Section Prominence
**Why:** 25% of members, currently expanding, unique differentiator
**How:**
- Featured section on homepage
- Dedicated page with photos
- Clear in navigation
- Separate tryout flow
- Testimonials emphasizing privacy/comfort

### 4. Mobile-First Experience
**Why:** Most gym searchers browse on mobile
**How:**
- Design for mobile first, scale up to desktop
- Fast loading (<3 seconds on 3G)
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44x44px)
- Readable text (min 16px)
- Forms optimized for mobile keyboards

### 5. Admin Panel Simplicity
**Why:** Rashid wants minimal management, quick visibility of signups
**How:**
- Dashboard shows counts at a glance
- Mark as "processed" with one click
- All SEPA details visible for Mollie entry
- No complex features needed
- Mobile-accessible admin (tablet/phone)

### 6. Legal SEPA Compliance
**Why:** Collecting IBAN requires proper authorization
**How:**
- Full SEPA mandaat text in Dutch
- Required checkboxes for consent
- Privacy policy and terms & conditions pages
- Data encryption for sensitive info
- Clear language about recurring payments

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Known Constraints
1. **Owner Involvement:** Rashid prefers minimal public profile and limited time for reviews
2. **Payment Process:** Must keep manual Mollie subscription creation (owner preference for control)
3. **Budget:** Very cost-conscious, wants free/low-cost solutions
4. **Photography:** Current photos are placeholder quality, better ones post-launch
5. **Staffing:** Lean operation, no dedicated marketing/web person
6. **Domain:** Must use existing fitcityculemborg.nl (brand recognition)

### Assumptions to Validate
1. **MDT Break Out:** Details coming from owner soon (page can be added after launch if needed)
2. **Email Access:** Assuming itnerdnl@gmail.com can receive form notifications reliably
3. **Cloudflare Access:** Yannick can set up DNS and Cloudflare Pages
4. **Rashid's Tech Comfort:** Admin panel needs to be very simple (TBD how tech-savvy)
5. **Class Schedule:** Kickboxing classes exist on regular schedule (need specific times for booking system)
6. **Google Business Profile:** Assuming current data is accurate and Rashid maintains it
7. **Form Volume:** Expecting moderate traffic, not enterprise-scale (simple database sufficient)

### Risks to Mitigate
1. **DNS Transfer Delays:** Plan for 24-48 hours propagation
2. **Content Gaps:** Use placeholders where client info pending, mark for Phase 2
3. **Photo Quality:** Design works with placeholders, easily swap in real photos later
4. **Legal Text:** Use vetted templates for SEPA/privacy/terms, but may need legal review
5. **Email Deliverability:** Test notification emails thoroughly, have backup (WhatsApp notification)
6. **Form Spam:** Implement rate limiting and basic honeypot protection
7. **Admin Panel Access:** If Cloudflare Zero Trust setup delays, have simple password fallback
